    "SQL and NoSQL are two different types of database management systems (DBMS) that handle data in distinct ways:\n",

    "These databases are characterized by their predefined schemas, which define the structure of the data, such as tables, columns, and relationships.\n",

    "Advantages of SQL databases:\n",
    "Strong data consistency and integrity due to strict schemas.\n",
    "Support for complex queries using SQL.\n",
    "Well-suited for applications that require structured data and complex relationships.\n",
    "Mature and widely adopted, with a large ecosystem of tools and support.\n",
    "Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data. \n",
    "They provide a flexible schema design, allowing for dynamic changes in the data structure without requiring a predefined schema. \n",
    "NoSQL databases are often used in scenarios where data needs to be distributed across multiple servers, as they offer scalability and\n",

    "Advantages of NoSQL databases:\n",
    "Flexible schema design allows for agile development and easy handling of evolving data structures.\n",
    "Horizontal scalability and high-performance capabilities.\n",
    "Ability to handle large amounts of unstructured data, such as documents, graphs, key-value pairs, or time-series data.\n",
    "Well-suited for applications that require high availability and scalability, such as web applications and big data processing.\n",
